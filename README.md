FPS in Unity with C#

This game started off following the quill18 creates youtube series on FPS games. His tips on lightmapping, blob projectors, 
and making simple levels in blender were very helpful. I pick up where he left off and finish off the FPS features.
Crouching and sprinting were implenented for the character. A gun was added, based off of raycast detection. A menu and hud 
were added. Finally more levels and basic AI were implemented.

The models and level were done by myself in Blender. All other assets are free with Unity.
The font was Wet Paint from dafont.com. The sounds were written and produced by Ove Melaa (Omsofware@hotmail.com).
